                "The camp was considered one of the 'better' camps due to its relatively moderate climate and agricultural success.",
                "Gila River became known for its educational and recreational programs, including a high school that gained accreditation from the state of Arizona.",
                "The camp's baseball team, the Butte High Eagles, became legendary in the camp system, playing against teams from other camps and nearby communities.",
                "Despite being in the desert, inmates managed to create gardens and parks, including a 3-acre park with grass, trees, and a pond.",
                "The camp maintained good relations with the surrounding Native American community, with some tribal members working in the camp and inmates helping with reservation agricultural projects."
