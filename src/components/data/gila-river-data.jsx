                <p><span className="font-bold text-blue-600 mt-1 inline-block">History: </span> Gila River was on Pima Indian Reservation land. The WRA director Milton Eisenhower refused to relinquish administrative control of the camp to the Office of Indian Affairs, probably because of the potential for profitable agricultural enterprise here. Much of the administration staff at Gila came from OIA personnel.</p>

                <p>Gila had the most extensive agricultural program of all the camps. At its peak, Gila farmed approximately 7,000 acres, 3,000 in vegetable crops, some of which were shipped to other camps. Gila had 2,000 head of cattle, 2,500 hogs, 25,000 chickens, and 110 dairy cows. Fields of stocks and marigolds were also grown here for center consumption.</p>

                <p>Gila saw four project directors in its first eight months. The fourth, LH Bennett, remained director from December 12, 1942 to July 31, 1945.</p>

                <p>The camp was marred by inadequate housing, as people poured into a center which was not yet complete. As a result, Americans were housed in every conceivable space, in nearly constant 100 degree temperatures, until construction could be completed. Schools opened in October 1942 despite the almost total lack of supplies and furniture.</p>

                <p>On November 30, 1942, Takeo Tada was beaten by a group of men. He had been employed by both the Turlock "Assembly Center" and Gila administrations and was targeted as an "inu" (dog) by those angry over a delay in clothing allocations and at the administration in general. Hearings resulted in a 30 day jail sentance for the admitted perpetrator, amid a tense atmosphere where much of the camp population supported the attacker.</p>

                <p>Inadequate sanitation and sewage facilities coupled with the wind, dust, and heat, led to outbreaks of diarrhea, tuberculosis, "Valley Fever", and other less serious disorders.</p>

                <p>When Eleanor Roosevelt was to visit one of the camps in the Spring of 1943, Gila was the one chosen, undoubtably because it had the best appearance.</p>
