            history={[
                "The weather, along with the shoddy construction of the barracks and a population mostly from Southern California cities, unaccustomed to the cold, contributed to a great many illnesses that resulted in hospital overcrowding in the winter of 1942-43.",
                "In addition to the severe climate, Heart Mountain, like many other camps was plagued by duststorms and rattlesnakes.",
                "Despite the inhospitability of the area, Heart was to become one of the most successful camps in terms of agriculture; many crops that had never been grown in the area before were introduced.",
                "Heart Mountain residents were stung by a series of muckraking articles about the camp by Denver Post reporter Jack Carberry, alleging, among other things, that the inmate population was being 'coddled'.",
                "Heart Mountain was the site of the only organized resistance to the military draft. Beginning in February 1944, the FPC organized in Heart Mountain around the issue of drafting Nisei from the concentration camps for military service. Citing the Constitution, the members of the FPC stated that they would not report to the draft board if called upon until their rights as citizens were restored."
