                "Tule Lake became a maximum security segregation center in 1943, designated to house those deemed 'disloyal' based on their answers to the controversial loyalty questionnaire.",
                "The camp was the largest and most controversial of the ten WRA camps, known for its resistance movements and civil disobedience.",
                "After segregation, the camp was surrounded by an additional fence and guard towers, and military police presence was increased.",
                "The camp experienced several strikes and protests, including a major incident in November 1943 that led to martial law being declared.",
                "Many of the segregees were kibei (American-born Japanese educated in Japan) who had answered 'no-no' to questions 27 and 28 on the loyalty questionnaire.",
                "The camp remained open the longest of all WRA camps, finally closing on March 20, 1946.",
                "Tule Lake's agricultural program was one of the most successful, with over 2,800 acres under cultivation."
