    The Internee as Official Camp Photographer

        The official camp photographers were internees who were amateur or professional photographers previous to being interned. Official camp photographers became more common around 1943, about a year after the camps were started. They functioned as school photographers, official government photographers, and portrait photographers in the camps. Many camps only had camp photographers.

            Before the war, Miyatake had a commercial photo studio in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles. He had studied with Edward Westin and won many photography awards. Miyatake realized that cameras were contraband but was able to get his camera lens pass the guards and inspections. While in Manzanar, he had the carpenter build a light tight box for his lens and sent his negatives to photography friends on the outside to get developed. Edward Weston was a friend whose photographs he helped sell to the Japanese American community before the war. Westin's recommendation to the camp director helped gain his confidence and he became the camp photographer. He was eventually able to practice his craft more openly.

            Fukuyama was a serious amateur photographer before the war and had won a Kodak award in photography in 1932. There is little information about his life as a photographer in the camps. How he got his cameras into the camps, how he got his film developed and printed before he became camp photographer is not known. He originally lived in Los Angeles and returned to L.A. after the camps.

            James Yonemura served as one of Heart Mountain's official camp photographers. While little personal information about him has been preserved, his work as camp photographer was significant in documenting important community moments, including weddings and other ceremonies. One such photograph appears in Grace Akiya's collection - her wedding portrait, which represents both the formal documentation of camp life through an official photographer and the personal preservation of family memories by internees themselves.
