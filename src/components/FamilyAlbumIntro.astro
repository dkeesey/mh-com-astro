          These family album pages show pictures from the daily lives of the internees, in both the Canadian and American camps. 
          In a variety of ways cameras were brought in the camps, loaned out to friends, film processed, and the rituals of daily life were preserved.

        During the course of working on this project, Hayashi traveled to photograph each camp site, and also attended reunions 
        and conferences for the camp survivors and their relatives. She came into contact with internees and their relatives, 
        many of whom had collected and saved fascinating albums of photographs from the time that they were interned. 
        This exhibit, curated by Masumi Hayashi, is a small sampling of those memories.

        These web site pages, and the 1996 exhibition of these photographs, document the human experience are part of 
        the memory of dislocation and transition.
