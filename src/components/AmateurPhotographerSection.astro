        Most internees documentated their lives just as most people want some documentation of their existence, whether it be day to day life or special family rituals. The pleasures of being photographed and to photograph is universally common The desire to document our existence through the photograph is as strong in our psyche as producing progeny. there is a need to create this reality for posterity through snapshots and the family album. With the camp regulations on contraband this idea of the family photograph had became illegal at most camps. This repression of the camera and the family photograph helped keep and maintain this family secret of internment life and created a caste of shame and guilt on this passage.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Within all the ten relocation camps, cameras were considered contraband and confiscated. Exceptions to the rule happened, and a few internees managed to bring their cameras in with them. Heart Mountain Relocation Camp seemed to be an exception, as there were several family albums being passed around during the 1995 Heart Mountain conference and the Gila River relocation camp reunion. In 1943, the illegality of taking snapshots at Heart Mountain was relaxed and camp officials allowed cameras and photographs. This seemed to be unique to one or two of the camps out of the ten camps. As the end of war seemed evident, the security involving both movie cameras and still cameras became more and more relaxed. The government became more focused on the transformation of the internee to fit into normal American live and to live within the free American community.

            Mrs. Akiya purchased her Kodak box camera for $4.98 in Los Angeles before the war. When she packed for evacuation it was in the bottom of her duffel bag and she had forgotten about it. As she went through inspection at Assembly Center the guard either did not see the camera or let it pass through. She had forgotten she had it in the bag but was thankful later she did unconsciously bring it. She had a friend in L.A. who would send her film and who would have her prints processed and printed.

            She photographed her sisters, brothers, family members, and friends and babies. She and her husband, Ed Akiya, were married in camp and the camp photographer, James Yonemura took a makeshift wedding photograph for them.

            Mrs. Morioka immigrated to San Francisco, California, when she was four years old. She was living in Hollywood, California, and working as an extra for MGM studios when she was evacuated. She was a classical singer and ballet dancer. Her parents were deceased. She brought in with her a momento from her father, a folding Kodak camera, which she was able to pass through the guards and inspections at Santa Anita Assembly Center and at Heart Mountain. Restrictions became more lenient. She was notable to get film or processing until she got to the Heart Mountain Relocation Camp. Montgomery Wards sent catalogues to the internees and she was able order film and processing through mail order.

            The photographs she took were of other mothers and their children, friends, and extended family such as soldiers going off to fight in Europe, people who were part of the Hawaiian band her husband played for in the camps. She was the hula dancer in the band. Both she and her husband had no immediate family in the camps.

            Mrs. Hashiguichi accidentally brought in her the Kodak box camera she received as a gift on her sixteenth birthday. It was confiscated at the Fresno Assembly Center by the guards during inspection. Her brothers were sent out to Jerome Relocation Center to do construction work on that camp and were able to retrieve the numerous contraband items taken from them, like knitting needles, scissors, and her camera. At the Jerome Relocation Camp, she was able to get film and get processing at the canteen. She also used the camp photographer's service of processing and prints.

            The photographs she took reflected her interests in team sports as she took numerous group snapshots of various sports teams organized in the camps.

          TOKUYE SATO, born unknown, resettled in Los Angeles. Interned in Topaz Relocation Camp.

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Tokuye Sato was released to work as a carpenter from Topaz Relocation Camp in 1943. He had a friend buy a Contax 35mm camera for him and he would bring it in when he visited his mother in the camp. When he was assigned to the construction crew of the Topaz camp hospital he would develop his film at the hospital's x-ray darkroom. His camera was confiscated once when entering the camp and he was held by the FBI for a brief time. His camera was returned to him when it was discovered he was only photographing friends and family. Visitors were allowed to bring cameras in, but for the internees it was considered contraband at Topaz.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The curious thing about this photographer was his patience. He saved his film, until he took a photography course at South West College in L.A.in 1987, ten years ago. He waited 40 years to see what the prints looked like.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Sato's snapshots represent a range of interests but one of the more recurring reflects his interest at the time and most of the images are of teenage girls in various postures of giggling.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Ms. Jane Beckwith of Delta, Utah, introduced me to Sato's photographs when I was photographing Topaz Relocation Camp in 1995.
