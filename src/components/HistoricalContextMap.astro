      <p>Following Executive Order 9066, approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans were forcibly relocated from the West Coast exclusion area (highlighted) to ten major internment camps across the United States. This mass incarceration during World War II impacted entire communities, with families losing their homes, businesses, and constitutional rights.</p>
