          These photographs are about beauty and irony, history and memory. The panoramic 
          photo collages are a reconstruction of space, a remapping of space. These are 
          landscapes of place representing the memory of that land and that place. As a 
          Japanese American sansei who was born in these camps, I feel that this body of 
          work goes beyond these conceptual aspects.
        </p>

        <p>
          The photo collages in this group exhibit symbolize a darker past in the American 
          landscape. These are the remains of four of the ten concentration camps that 
          interned 120,000 Japanese Americans during WWII. This is the collective memory 
          of these American citizens who found themselves in their own homeland, suddenly 
          without a country to call their own, called "enemy aliens" and prisoners in 
          their own hometown.
        </p>

        <p>
          My panoramic photo collages are created from multiple exposures, shot from a 
          single point perspective, and rotated 360 degrees. Multiple images are then 
          taped together to create a surrounding panoramic space. The collaged photographs 
          create a visual tension between the physical beauty of these landscapes and 
          their historical darkness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through these images, I seek to preserve not just the physical remains of these 
          sites, but also the emotional and historical weight they carry. Each photograph 
          is a meditation on memory, justice, and the enduring human spirit in the face 
          of adversity.
