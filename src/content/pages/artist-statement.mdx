These photographs are about beauty and irony, history and memory. The panoramic photo collages are a reconstruction of space, a remapping of space. These are landscapes of place representing the memory of that land and that place. As a Japanese American sansei who was born in these camps, I feel that this body of work goes beyond these conceptual aspects.

The photo collages in this group exhibit symbolize a darker past in the American landscape. These are the remains of four of the ten concentration camps that interned 120,000 Japanese Americans during WWII. This is the collective memory of these American citizens who found themselves in their own homeland, suddenly without a country to call their own, called "enemy aliens" and prisoners in their own hometown. Within weeks after the evacuation of the Japanese Americans, the Japanese Canadians faced the same fate in Canada.

Holocaust, ethnic cleansing, genocide and violent murders are part of the European history of concentration camps. With the voice of Radio Free Europe to the Communist world, America appeared to Europe as the land of the free. In a less violent way, the Japanese American internment camps was a contradiction to the stereotype of America. Racism seems to know no boundaries. Institutional racism became a unique part of the twentieth century. This camp experience was based on fear and intolerance of difference. Although it manifests itself in a less violent way in the United States, it was the government who sanctioned a policy to discriminate based on race. All of these camps have been a violation of human rights. But for the U.S. it became a violation of civil liberties from which our Constitutional Bill of Rights is based.

Although the violence was not as extreme as in the European history, the Japanese American story and Japanese Canadian story includes common threads. The Japanese Americans were uprooted from their homes and jobs, segregated into camps, guarded with guns, and surrounded by barbed wire. Their experiences included displacement, imprisonment, and isolating these people within ghettos. It left these people a sense of guilt and wrongdoing (as in rape victims). The residual guilt of these victims caused their silence and quiet for many years after the terror of the experience.

Of the 120,000 Japanese Americans and 23,000 Japanese Canadians interned there were no trials to prove guilt or innocence of any crime, no convictions of espionage or treason. Almost fifty years later, American Presidents Clinton and Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney issued letters of apology to those still living who had been interned in these camps, acknowledging their government's mistake.

These photographs exhibited are the backdrop for the special memorial of "Day of Remembrance" we will have here at the CSU Art Gallery on February 17th, at 4PM. Day of remembrance is usually on February 19th and is significant of the day of evacuation in 1942. Join us in a candle light memorial and lecture and discussion.
