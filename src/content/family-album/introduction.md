These family album pages show pictures from the daily lives of the internees, in both the Canadian and American camps. In a variety of ways cameras were brought in the camps, loaned out to friends, film processed, and the rituals of daily life were preserved.

During the course of working on this project, Hayashi traveled to photograph each camp site, and also attended reunions and conferences for the camp survivors and their relatives. She came into contact with internees and their relatives, many of whom had collected and saved fascinating albums of photographs from the time that they were interned.

This exhibit, curated by Masumi Hayashi, is a small sampling of those memories.  These web site pages, and the 1996 exhibition of these photographs, document the human experience are part of the memory of dislocation and transition.

## About the Exhibition

The exhibition features photographs from various photographers who documented life in the internment camps. These photographers included both official camp photographers and internees who managed to bring cameras into the camps. Their work provides an invaluable record of daily life, relationships, and the resilience of the Japanese American and Japanese Canadian communities during internment.

## Exhibition Views

The exhibition was presented at the Cleveland State University Art Gallery, showcasing these important historical photographs and documents. The installation aimed to present these personal histories in a way that honors both the photographers and the subjects of their work.
