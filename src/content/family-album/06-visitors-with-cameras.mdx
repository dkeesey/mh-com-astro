# Visitors with Cameras

While cameras were contraband for internees, visitors were allowed to bring cameras into the camps. This created rare opportunities for families to have their photographs taken, preserving precious memories of their time in the camps.

## Stories from the Camps

### Minidoka Relocation Camp

This photograph of Shim Yamamoto's mother, Shigeyo Yamamoto, was taken on the doorstep of the barracks by a visitor to the camps who had a camera. Shim's sister, Mary Nakanishi, said it was a soldier visiting his parents who took this snapshot, though she does not remember who it was.

Visitors were allowed to bring cameras in, but for the internees still in the camps it was considered contraband at Minidoka.

Shim Yamamoto resettled in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1943, on a work release program. His mother and sister joined him in Cleveland in 1945. Shim Yamamoto moved to Seattle in 1995 and writes articles for the Cleveland JACL newsletter.

### Amache Relocation Camp (Granada)

[Tayeko Nomura](/family-album/photographers/nomura) was interned at Granada Relocation Camp in Colorado. She married Tayeko Nomura in camp and they resettled nearby Las Cantinas in Colorado as farmers.

She kept these camp snapshots in a shoebox with other small keepsakes from that time. Mrs. Tayeko Nomura does not remember who took the photos nor many of the internees in the photos. Mr. Emery Nomura was in the hospital at time of the interview and visit.

The Granada high school history teacher, John Hooper, referred me to Mr. and Mrs. Nomura. He has a Granada high school class on the history of the Amache Internment camp where the students study the archeology/history of the site and the stories of the internees (met during reunions). They will have a website soon.

## Historical Significance

These photographs taken by visitors represent an important part of the historical record, as they often captured moments and perspectives that would have otherwise been lost. The fact that visitors were allowed cameras while internees were not highlights the complex and often contradictory nature of camp policies and restrictions.
