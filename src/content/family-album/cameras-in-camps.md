The camera was considered contraband for the internees during the incarceration, since they were considered enemy aliens. Cameras were mainly of two types: the amateur box camera, a "point and shoot" type, and a more complex camera with f-stops and shutter speeds for the more serious amateur.

## Types of Camp Photographers

- Media organizations photographers (Life Magazine and newspapers)
- Official camp photographers who worked for the government
- WRA photographers who were not internees
- Amateur photographers, including both visitors and internees who managed to get cameras into the camp

The content of photographs for mass distribution was restricted to what media editors or the government wanted to show. Many internee photographers documented their personal life as well. The photographs included here were taken by the internees, sometimes just after they were recently released either on work release or as soldiers to fight in WWII.
