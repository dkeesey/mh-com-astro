Before the war, Miyatake had a commercial photo studio in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles. He had studied with Edward Westin and won many photography awards. Miyatake realized that cameras were contraband but was able to get his camera lens past the guards and inspections. 

While in Manzanar, he had the carpenter build a light-tight box for his lens and sent his negatives to photography friends on the outside to get developed. Edward Weston was a friend whose photographs he helped sell to the Japanese American community before the war. Weston's recommendation to the camp director helped gain his confidence and he became the camp photographer. He was eventually able to practice his craft more openly.
