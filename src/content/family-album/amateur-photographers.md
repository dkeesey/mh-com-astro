description: "How internees documented their lives despite restrictions"
---

Most internees documented their lives just as most people want some documentation of their existence, whether it be day to day life or special family rituals. With the camp regulations on contraband, the idea of the family photograph had become illegal at most camps. This repression of the camera and the family photograph helped keep and maintain this family secret of internment life and created a caste of shame and guilt on this passage.

Within all the ten relocation camps, cameras were considered contraband and confiscated. Exceptions to the rule happened, and a few internees managed to bring their cameras in with them. Heart Mountain Relocation Camp seemed to be an exception, as there were several family albums being passed around. In 1943, the illegality of taking snapshots at Heart Mountain was relaxed and camp officials allowed cameras and photographs.
