# CONTRABAND, THE CAMERA, THE PHOTOGRAPH, AND THE FAMILY ALBUM.

* * *

## THE CAMERA and THE PHOTOGRAPHER.

The camera was considered contraband for the internees during the incarceration, since they were considered enemy aliens. Cameras were mainly of two types: the amateur box camera, a "point and shoot" type, and a more complex camera with f-stops and shutter speeds for the more serious amateur. The photographer who owned the cameras or parts of the cameras, which were considered contraband, were either serious amateurs or professionals.

Photographers who were taking pictures of relocation camp life were either:

-   from media organizations, like [Life Magazine](/family-album/photographers/professional) and newspapers,
-   an official camp photographer who also worked for the government,
-   a WRA photographer who was not an internee and who worked for the government, or
-   an "amateur", which included both the visitors to the camps, and the internees who managed to get cameras into the camp (which was difficult since it was considered contraband).

The content of photographs for mass distribution was restricted to what mass media editors or the government wanted to show. Many internee photographers documented their personal life as well. The photographs included in this web site were taken by the internees, sometimes just after they were recently released either on work release or as soldiers to fight in WWII.

There are times when snapshots and family album photographs go beyond the common ritual. Ironically, Kodak with its "you take the picture, we do the rest." mail order marketing strategy made it possible for the uncommon event of incarceration of the Japanese American family to be recorded. These photographers exist as the witness and they provide us with this reconstruction of that history and that cultural phenomenon.
