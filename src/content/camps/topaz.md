  The Topaz War Relocation Center, commonly known as Topaz, was one of ten concentration camps used for the wartime incarceration of Japanese Americans. Located in Millard County, Utah, near the city of Delta, the camp opened in September 1942 and closed in October 1945.

  The site was chosen for its isolation and consisted of approximately 19,800 acres of extremely harsh desert terrain. Internees faced severe weather conditions, with temperatures ranging from below freezing in winter to over 100°F (38°C) in summer, compounded by frequent dust storms.

# Historical Overview

The Topaz concentration camp, officially designated as the Central Utah Relocation Center, was constructed in the summer of 1942. The first internees arrived on September 11, 1942, primarily Japanese Americans who had been previously held at the Tanforan Assembly Center in California.

The camp was laid out in a one-mile square, with guard towers positioned at regular intervals along the perimeter fence. The living areas were divided into blocks, each containing 12 residential barracks, a mess hall, a recreation hall, and a combination bathroom-laundry facility.
