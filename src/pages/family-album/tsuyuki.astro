Some families in Vancouver left before the forced evacuation. These families resettled in towns where \"self-supporting\" camps were designated. As in the States, they were told they could relocate away from the Coast. But most people did not realize the implications of evacution and/or did not have the resources to move within a week or a month."

          Norman Tsuyuki's photographs provide a unique perspective of life in the Lillooet self-supporting camp during World War II. 
          As a teenage photographer during the internment, he documented daily life, cultural traditions, and agricultural activities 
          of Japanese-Canadian families who chose to evacuate to self-supporting camps. His photographs capture both the preservation 
          of cultural practices and the adaptations required by their circumstances, including farming activities and religious ceremonies.

        <p class="mt-4">
          Cameras and guns and knives and all sharp utencils were considered contraband and were confiscated, making these photographic 
          records particularly rare and valuable historical documents of the internment experience.
