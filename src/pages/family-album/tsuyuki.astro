    description: "Prewar families were free to hunt and fish and live as free Canadian citizens. During WWII they were labeled \"enemy aliens\" and they were rounded up and interned. Some families in Vancouver left before the forced evacuation. These families resettled in towns where \"self-supporting\" camps were designated. As in the States, they were told they could relocate away from the Coast. But most people did not realize the implications of evacuation and/or did not have the resources to move within a week or a month. Cameras and guns and knives and all sharp utensils were considered contraband and were confiscated."

    alt: "Traditional massage",
    description: "After a day's work on the farms it was part of the culture to enjoy both the bath, furo, and the massage. The art of massage was passed down from parents to children."
