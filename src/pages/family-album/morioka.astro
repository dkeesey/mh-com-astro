    maintained their dignity and relationships despite their circumstances.

    These photographs serve as important historical documents, showing how Japanese Americans adapted to life in 
    the camps while preserving their cultural identity and family bonds. The collection includes portraits, 
    group photos, and scenes of daily life that help us understand this challenging period in American history.
