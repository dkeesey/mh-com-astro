He had been an 'A' student and president of many organizations at UCLA before the evacuation. He was going overseas to join the 442nd to serve his country. He felt he could make a difference. He was one of the many casualties that the 442nd and the 100th battalions suffered during the war. Many of the Hawaiian Japanese of the 100th battalion found it difficult to believe that the Japanese Americans on the mainland were in concentration camps and with them fighting for the same country that incarcerated them."

Although most of the photographs are of family and friends, there seem to be some that create exceptional irony. This is the father/daughter portrait in front of the guard tower of the camp. Many other photographers show the barbed wire fence or the guard tower as part of the portrait."

  <p>
    The photographs of June Utako Morioka from Heart Mountain Relocation Camp offer a deeply personal perspective 
    of life during internment, preserved and shared through her daughter Lani Sanjek. Her images capture poignant 
    moments that illustrate both the everyday realities of camp life and its profound ironies.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4">
    Among her most moving photographs is that of a young UCLA student who, despite his internment, chose to serve 
    in the legendary 442nd Regimental Combat Team. This image represents the complex patriotism of Japanese Americans 
    who fought for a country that had imprisoned their families. Tragically, he would become one of the many casualties 
    suffered by the highly decorated unit.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4">
    Morioka's photography also captured the stark juxtaposition of family life against the camp's prison-like 
    setting, exemplified in the powerful father-daughter portrait deliberately composed with a guard tower in the 
    background. These images, preserved and shared through generations, serve as both family mementos and powerful 
    historical documents of this period in American history.
