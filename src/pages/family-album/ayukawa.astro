  <p>
    Dr. Midge Ayukawa's family album provides an intimate look at life in the Lemon Creek Internment Camp during World War II. 
    These photographs, many taken with a borrowed box camera, document both the hardships and the resilience of Japanese-Canadian 
    families during their internment. The collection spans from pre-camp life in Vancouver to the daily experiences within 
    the camp, capturing moments of family life despite the difficult circumstances.
