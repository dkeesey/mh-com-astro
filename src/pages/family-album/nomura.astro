Amache was located in the middle of southern Colorado farmland. The internees brought in irrigation and farmed vegetables and fruits never seen in this region before. There was alot of interaction with the small town people of Granada and the camp internees. A reversal, the town people were even allowed to shop in the Amache camp canteen on the weekends. The reunions here introduce the Granada High School history students to returning internees and their stories and memories. They go from school to school in Colorado to talk about this camp."

          The Amache Relocation Camp, officially known as the Granada War Relocation Center, was unique among the internment 
          camps for its remarkable agricultural achievements and its unusual relationship with the nearby town of Granada. 
          The internees transformed the arid Colorado landscape through irrigation, introducing new varieties of vegetables 
          and fruits previously unknown to the region.

          Photography at Amache captured both the harsh realities of camp life - evident in images of guard towers and 
          barbed wire fences - and the resilient spirit of the community. Internees used creative techniques like photo 
          collage to document their surroundings, creating panoramic views that provided a broader perspective of the camp's 
          layout and scale.
        </p>

          The camp's legacy continues through educational initiatives, with former internees sharing their experiences 
          with Colorado high school students. These photographs serve not only as personal mementos but as powerful 
          historical documents that help tell the story of Amache to new generations.
