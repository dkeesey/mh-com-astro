          Professional photography of the internment camps served multiple purposes, from propaganda to documentation. 
          These images provide a unique perspective - the view from the outside looking in - and often reflected the 
          government's attempt to control the narrative around internment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Media outlets like Life Magazine portrayed a carefully curated version of camp life, emphasizing the 
          government's role as a "caretaker" while glossing over the harsh realities of imprisonment. Meanwhile, 
          camp publications like the Tule Lake Guardsman Magazine offered glimpses into the complex relationship 
          between guards and internees.
        </p>
        <p>
          The commercial aspect of internment photography is particularly striking in the production of camp postcards, 
          including aerial views that were sold to internees themselves. These images, along with panoramic photographs 
          of arrivals and departures, document the scale of displacement while simultaneously serving as artifacts of 
          how the camps were presented to the wider public.
