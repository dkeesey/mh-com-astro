Her parents had moved back to Japan when she was a child and she returned after high school to the country of her birth, the U.S., alone and without parents. She lived and worked for a concerned woman in Los Angeles. At the first warning signs of incarceration she was encouraged to move to areas of the midwest by her employer but she had a hard time beliving she would be incarcerated."

    description: "Mrs. Grace Akiya photographed extensively in the camp, recording her friends and brothers. She married Ed Akiya when Heart Mountain first opened up as a camp and they had to be married by the justice of the peace in Cody, Wyoming, the nearest town. They went to town under guard in a guard truck for their weeding and stopped at a 5 & 10 store to pick up presents for some of their friends in the camp. Friends made the paper flowers she had on her dress. She made her wedding dress. Camp photographer, James Yonemura, took their wedding picture with a crate to sit on and the bare wooden floor of the barracks, and a sheet hung up for the backdrop. This wedding portrait exemplifies how internees used formal photography to maintain dignity despite their circumstances. The makeshift backdrop, wooden floor, and borrowed crate contrast sharply with the couple's formal dress and composed expressions - a visual testament to both resilience and the reality of imprisonment."

    description: "Mrs. Grace Akiya was encouraged to continue photographing in the camp by her friend and former employer. She would send the film to her on the outside and it would be sent back developed and printed. The camera passed inspection when entering the camp because she did not know she had it in her duffle bag. The guards did not see on the bottom of the bag.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Akiya resettled in Cleveland, Ohio. They both took up judo and opened their dojo a few years after they arrived. Judo was also considered contraband while incarcerated in the camps. Mrs. Grace Akiya is currently active teaching judo at the Midwest Judo Academy in Cleveland and is a fourth degree black belt and is in her 80's."

          Mrs. Grace Akiya's photographs provide a remarkable window into life at Heart Mountain Relocation Camp. Having returned 
          to the United States from Japan in 1938, she brought with her a box camera that would later become contraband in the camps. 
          Despite initial warnings about incarceration, she found herself at Heart Mountain where she continued to document camp life, 
          secretly developing her photos through a friend on the outside. Her collection includes intimate moments like her own wedding 
          to Ed Akiya—a ceremony conducted under guard in Cody, Wyoming—and daily life in the camp. After the war, the Akiyas built 
          a new life in Cleveland, Ohio, where they established a dojo and became pillars of the judo community, with Mrs. Akiya 
          achieving the rank of fourth degree black belt.

          These photographs, many showing people in formal dress and careful poses, represent more than mere documentation - they are acts of quiet resistance and dignity preservation. When Grace Akiya accidentally brought her Kodak box camera into Heart Mountain, she became not just a photographer but a keeper of dignity for her community. Her wedding photos are particularly poignant: despite having to marry under guard and create her own wedding dress, the formal poses and careful attention to appearance - including handmade paper flowers - show how internees maintained their humanity through ritual and celebration even while imprisoned. The fact that she had to secretly develop her photos through an outside friend underscores how even the simple act of documenting one's life had become an act of resistance. Each photograph in her collection, from portraits to daily life scenes, captures both the visible effort to maintain dignity and the invisible weight of incarceration.
