She lived and worked for a concerned woman in Los Angeles. At the first warning signs of incarceration she was encouraged to move to areas of the midwest by her employer but she had a hard time beliving she would be incarcerated."

She married Ed Akiya when Heart Mountain first opened up as a camp and they had to be married by the justice of the peace in Cody, Wyoming, the nearest town. They went to town under guard in a guard truck for their weeding and stopped at a 5 & 10 store to pick up presents for some of their friends in the camp. Friends made the paper flowers she had on her dress. She made her wedding dress. Camp photographer, James Yonemura, took their wedding picture with a crate to sit on and the bare wooden floor of the barracks, and a sheet hung up for the backdrop."

The camera passed inspection when entering the camp because she did not know she had it in her duffle bag. The guards did not see on the bottom of the bag."

          Grace Akiya was a remarkable photographer who documented life at Heart Mountain Relocation Camp with her box camera, 
          which she had purchased upon returning to the United States from Japan in 1938. Despite being encouraged to move to 
          the Midwest to avoid incarceration, she found herself at Heart Mountain where she continued her photography, secretly 
          bringing her camera into the camp.

          Her photography captured intimate moments of camp life, including her own wedding to Ed Akiya at the camp. The couple 
          had to travel under guard to Cody, Wyoming for their civil ceremony, where Grace wore a self-made wedding dress adorned 
          with paper flowers crafted by friends. Their wedding photo, taken by camp photographer James Yonemura, was staged with 
          simple props - a wooden crate and a sheet backdrop in the barracks.

          After the war, the Akiyas resettled in Cleveland, Ohio, where they established a dojo and became prominent figures in 
          the judo community. Mrs. Grace Akiya went on to earn a fourth-degree black belt and continued teaching judo at the 
          Midwest Judo Academy well into her 80s, demonstrating remarkable resilience and dedication throughout her life.
