const about = `
  <p>
    Toyo Miyatake was a professional photographer in Los Angeles' Little Tokyo district before World War II. 
    When he was incarcerated at Manzanar, he smuggled in a lens and film holder, later building a camera 
    from wood. Initially taking photos in secret, he was eventually allowed to be the camp's official photographer.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4">
    His photographs document daily life, special events, and the stark reality of incarceration at Manzanar. 
    His work provides both historical documentation and artistic interpretation of the Japanese American 
    internment experience.
