      <p>
        Toyo Miyatake was a professional photographer who was incarcerated at Manzanar. Despite cameras being considered contraband, he managed to document life in the camp using various format cameras. His photographs provide a unique insider's perspective of daily life, celebrations, and the resilience of the Japanese-American 
        community during their internment at Manzanar.
