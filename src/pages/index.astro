      <p>
        Welcome to the official archive celebrating the legacy of Professor Masumi
        Hayashi (1945-2006), a visionary artist whose panoramic photo collages
        have left an indelible mark on the world of photography and historical
        documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hayashi's work, exemplified by pieces like the Manzanar Concentration Camp
        Monument shown above, stands as a powerful testament to her unique ability
        to capture landscapes embedded with cultural memory. Her intricate
        panoramic photo collages, meticulously crafted from hundreds of individual
        film exposures, offer a profound engagement with historical sites and
        their enduring significance.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you explore this site, you'll discover Hayashi's groundbreaking project
        on Japanese American internment camps, a deeply personal journey that
        reflects her own history of being born in one such camp. Through her lens,
        these sites of historical trauma are transformed into powerful visual
        narratives that resonate with contemporary audiences, inviting reflection
        on issues of memory, identity, and justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        We invite you to delve into Hayashi's extensive body of work, including
        her poignant internment camp series, the innovative Family Album Project,
        and her artist statements that provide insight into her creative process
        and motivations. Whether you're a long-time admirer of Hayashi's work or
        discovering it for the first time, this archive offers a comprehensive
        look at the life and art of this remarkable photographer.

      <h2>American Concentration Camps</h2>
      <p>
        The "American Concentration Camps" page exhibits artist/Professor
        Hayashi's panoramic photo collages of the 10 Japanese American relocation
        camps. These photographs only cover the relocation centers/camps. They do
        not address the assembly centers, the U.S. Justice Dept. camps or the
        prison and other WRA facilities.
      </p>
      <h2>The Family Album Project</h2>
      <p>
        "The Family Album Project" was an exhibition curated by Professor Hayashi
        for the Cleveland State University Art Gallery and the Ohio Arts Council.
        Even though cameras were contraband, family album snapshots were taken by
        internees and visitors to the camps. This part of the camp project defines
        the use of photography in terms of the Japanese American and Japanese
        Canadian internment.
      </p>

      <h2>Internee audio interviews</h2>
      <p>
        This is a 9 minute edited interview with Japanese American internees
        recalling evacuation and the heated climate during internment. Memories,
        survivors of the U.S. Concentration Camps for the Japanese Americans
        (Nikei) during WW II, from interviews by Masumi Hayashi, in 1992 and 1993.
        Audio mastered by James Abbott, produced by Masumi Hayashi, 1994,
        Cleveland, Ohio.
