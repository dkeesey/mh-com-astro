          These family album pages show pictures from the daily lives of the
          internees, in both the Canadian and American camps. In a variety of
          ways cameras were brought in the camps, loaned out to friends, film
          processed, and the rituals of daily life were preserved.

          During the course of working on this project, Hayashi traveled to
          photograph each camp site, and also attended reunions and conferences
          for the camp survivors and their relatives.

          The camera was considered contraband for the internees during the
          incarceration, since they were considered enemy aliens.

          Most internees documented their lives just as most people want some
          documentation of their existence, whether it be day to day life or
          special family rituals.
