              <p class="text-lg text-fa-text-secondary">
                These photographs require careful viewing. While many images show internees in formal dress and composed expressions, these should not be misinterpreted as signs of comfort or contentment. When forced into the camps, internees could bring only what they could carry in their suitcases. Their nice clothes - among their few preserved possessions - became powerful tools for maintaining dignity in the face of imprisonment. The act of dressing well and photographing themselves was a form of resistance against dehumanization, not evidence of "happy camps" as some mischaracterized them. These images document both the visible effort to preserve humanity and the invisible weight of dispossession and confinement.

              <p class="text-lg text-fa-text-secondary">
                The photographs you see on these pages exist in multiple historical layers. Originally taken in the 1940s, often with contraband cameras or through official camp photographers, they were preserved as small physical prints in family albums and collections. In 1998, as part of Masumi Hayashi's pioneering effort to create one of the first digital archives of internment camp photography, these images were digitized for early web presentation.
              </p>
              <p class="text-lg text-fa-text-secondary mt-4">
                The image quality and size you see today reflects both the original constraints of camp photography and the technical limitations of 1998-era web technology. While the original snapshots may have been similarly small in size, the digital versions you see here were specifically optimized for late-1990s computer screens and web browsers. We have chosen to preserve these digital artifacts in their 1998 form rather than artificially enhance them, as they represent not only historical documentation of the camps but also an early moment in the digital preservation of Japanese American history.
              </p>
              <p class="text-lg text-fa-text-secondary mt-4">
                This layered existence - from contraband camp photos to early digital archive - mirrors key themes in the project: how historical memory is preserved, transformed, and transmitted across generations and technologies.
