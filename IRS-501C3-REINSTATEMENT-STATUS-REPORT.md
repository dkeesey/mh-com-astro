## 3. Retroactive Reinstatement Eligibility

### 15-Month Critical Deadline
The Foundation may qualify for **retroactive reinstatement** (effective back to original revocation date) if:

1. **Timeline Met**: Application submitted within **15 months** of:
   - Date on Revocation Letter (CP-120A), OR
   - Date appeared on IRS Revocation List (whichever is later)

2. **Organization Size**: Foundation was eligible to file Form 990-EZ or 990-N for the three years that caused revocation

3. **No Prior Revocation**: Organization has not been previously automatically revoked

### If 15-Month Deadline Missed
- Reinstatement still possible but NOT retroactive
- Must provide "reasonable cause" statement for ALL three years of non-filing
- New determination letter will have effective date of application submission

### Action Required
- **VERIFY**: Check revocation letter date or IRS Revocation List posting date
- **CALCULATE**: Determine if 15-month deadline applies
- **PREPARE**: If past 15 months, ensure reasonable cause statement was included

## 9. Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can we accept donations while application is pending?
**A**: Yes, but donors cannot claim tax deductions until reinstatement is approved. If retroactive reinstatement is granted, donations made during the period may become tax-deductible retroactively. Consult with a tax attorney for donor communication.

### Q: How will we know if the application is approved?
**A**: IRS will send determination letter by mail. Also check TEOS for approval letter posting.

### Q: What if the application is denied?
**A**: IRS will explain reasons for denial. You can:
- Provide additional information
- Appeal the decision
- Submit corrected application
- Consult with nonprofit attorney

### Q: Can we apply for grants during this period?
**A**: Some funders may accept applications pending reinstatement. Disclose status clearly. Federal grants may require active 501(c)(3) status.

### Q: Do we need to refile for state tax exemption?
**A**: Depends on state requirements. Some states automatically recognize IRS determination; others require separate application. Check with Foundation's state (appears to be Ohio based on Canton Museum reference).

### Q: What's the cost if we need professional help?
**A**: Nonprofit attorneys typically charge $1,500-$5,000 for reinstatement assistance. Many offer free consultations.
