    <h1>The Family Album Pages</h1>
    <div class="intro">
      These family album pages show pictures from the daily lives of the internees, in both the Canadian and American camps. In a variety of ways cameras were brought in the camps, loaned out to friends, film processed, and the rituals of daily life were preserved.

    <h2>The Camera and The Photographer</h2>
    <div class="photo-details">
      The camera was considered contraband for the internees during the incarceration, since they were considered enemy aliens. Cameras were mainly of two types: the amateur box camera, a "point and shoot" type, and a more complex camera with f-stops and shutter speeds for the more serious amateur.
    </div>
    
    <p>Photographers who were taking pictures of relocation camp life were either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>from media organizations, like Life Magazine and newspapers</li>
      <li>an official camp photographer who also worked for the government</li>
      <li>a WRA photographer who was not an internee and who worked for the government</li>
      <li>an "amateur", which included both the visitors to the camps, and the internees who managed to get cameras into the camp</li>
    </ul>

        <span class="profile-name">Toyo Miyatake</span>
        <span class="metadata">1895-1979 • Manzanar Relocation Camp</span>
      </div>
      <p>Before the war, Miyatake had a commercial photo studio in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles. He had studied with Edward Westin and won many photography awards. Miyatake realized that cameras were contraband but was able to get his camera lens pass the guards and inspections.</p>
      <div class="quote">
        While in Manzanar, he had the carpenter build a light tight box for his lens and sent his negatives to photography friends on the outside to get developed.
